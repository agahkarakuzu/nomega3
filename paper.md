# Background

Chronic low-grade inflammation, characterized by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and neurodegeneration. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been proposed as anti-inflammatory agents, but their dose-dependent effects on systemic inflammation markers remain poorly characterized.

# Objective

To investigate the relationship between omega-3 fatty acid supplementation dose and reduction in serum CRP levels in adults with mild chronic inflammation.

# Methods

We conducted a 6-month open-label intervention study in 75 adults (mean age 45.2 ± 10.3 years, 48% female) with baseline CRP levels between 2-12 mg/L. Participants were provided with omega-3 supplements (EPA+DHA) at individualized dosages ranging from 500 to 5500 mg/day based on tolerance and compliance. Serum CRP was measured at baseline and 6 months post-intervention. The primary outcome was percent reduction in CRP levels.

# Results

Omega-3 supplementation demonstrated a significant positive correlation with CRP reduction (r = 0.78, p < 0.001; **Figure 1**). Participants achieved a mean CRP reduction of 14.3 ± 11.2%, with higher omega-3 doses associated with greater anti-inflammatory effects. Subjects in the high-compliance group (n=5) receiving doses above 4000 mg/day showed exceptional CRP reductions averaging 47.0 ± 3.2%. The intervention was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported.

The solid line shows the linear regression fit with 95% confidence interval (shaded area). A strong positive correlation was observed (r = {r:.2f}, p < 0.001), suggesting a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect.

# Conclusion

Our findings provide strong evidence for a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation ([](#fig1)). The robust correlation between omega-3 intake and CRP reduction suggests that higher doses may be particularly beneficial for individuals with elevated inflammatory markers. These results support the use of omega-3 supplementation as a therapeutic strategy for managing chronic inflammation and potentially reducing cardiovascular risk.
